## Introduction

If you are starting a SaaS product, the hardest part is not picking tools. It is shipping something small enough to test with real users. This is the stack I use most often: **Next.js 14** with the App Router and **Supabase** for auth and data.

## Why Next.js + Supabase?

- **Next.js** gives you server components, API routes, and a smooth developer experience.
- **Supabase** gives you Postgres, auth, and real-time features without setting up a full backend from scratch.

## Getting Started

1. Create a new Next.js app with \`create-next-app\`.
2. Add Supabase and configure your environment variables.
3. Set up Supabase Auth with email/password or OAuth.
4. Build your first protected route and a simple dashboard.

## Key Takeaways

- Use Server Components for data fetching where it makes sense.
- Protect routes with middleware or server-side checks.
- Keep version one small and ship fast.

## Why It Matters

Your portfolio is often the first thing a client or recruiter sees. If the site is slow or hard to find on Google, you lose attention before anyone reads your work.

## What I Focus On

- **Metadata**: Clear title, description, Open Graph, and Twitter cards.
- **Structured data**: JSON-LD for Person, WebSite, and FAQ content.
- **Sitemap and robots.txt**: So search engines can crawl the site properly.
- **Images**: Next.js \`Image\` with sensible sizes and lazy loading.

## Performance

- Keep client-side JavaScript lean with Server Components.
- Respect \`prefers-reduced-motion\` for accessibility.
- Use animation sparingly so the site still feels fast.

      'How I design practical n8n workflows that connect APIs, AI models, Google Sheets, and Gmail for lead qualification and content operations.',

## Why Automation Matters

Manual lead follow-up and repetitive content work slow teams down. With **n8n**, you can connect APIs, AI models, spreadsheets, and email into workflows that run on demand or on a schedule.

## Three Workflow Patterns I Use

1. **API ingestion**: Trigger a flow, fetch external data, reshape fields, and pass results to the next step.
2. **Content operations**: Schedule pipeline runs that prepare content, update Google Sheets, and send notifications.
3. **AI lead qualification**: Branch on conditions, score leads with an LLM like Groq, log outcomes, and alert via Gmail.

## Implementation Tips

- Keep each node focused on one job: fetch, transform, decide, or notify.
- Use clear branch labels so true and false paths stay easy to maintain.
- Log important outcomes to Sheets or a database before sending emails.
- Start with a manual trigger, then move proven flows to a schedule.

## Key Takeaways

- Automation works best when it removes busywork without hiding failures.
- AI fits in the middle of the workflow: after clean inputs, before storage and alerts.
- Ship small, observable flows first, then expand.
